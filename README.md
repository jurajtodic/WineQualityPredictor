# Predicting wine quality using machine learning algorithms

For a detailed report refer to the "Wine quality prediction report.pdf"

The task was to create a model with the ability to predict the quality of wine based on the physical and chemical properties of the wine. Analysis of the basic parameters that determine the quality of wine is crucial. Machine learning can be an alternative to identify the most important parameters that control the quality of wine. In this paper, it is shown how machine learning can be used to predict the quality of wine itself. An extensive dataset of 42833 examples was used, which contained physicochemical properties and appropriate quality. By combining these datasets, several model were built and trained. Their performance was evaluated and the best model was chose. Wine quality predictions are modeled as a regression problem.
